### Summary of What We Learned

In this activity, we learned how to work with a class Git repository and prepare files for submission. We practiced cloning a repository, editing a text file, and following clear instructions for uploading required documents. We also learned how to include personal and course information in a structured format by writing our name, course name, and a learning goal in a task file. Overall, this assignment helped us understand basic version control skills, file organization, and how to submit coursework correctly.
